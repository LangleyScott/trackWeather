This is trackWeather!

trackWeather is my first web app; I have been learning web development for about three weeks.

I am a huge NASCAR fan. NASCAR is very weather-sensitive. Race teams, promoters, TV crews and fans have spent countless hours refreshing forecasts, hoping they wouldn't have to wait to watch their favorite sport.

NASCAR is divided into three seperate racing series that race at different times during the weekend, sometimes at different tracks. Some race teams enter different cars in multiple series; on those weekends, it's essential for team leaders to know who's going to be racing and when, weather permitting. Wouldn't it be nice if they could get a quick look at the forecast at multiple race tracks?

I created trackWeather with the race team and race fan in mind. I watch every NASCAR race, and I will always check the weekend forecasts for each race location throughout the week using Google, and I thought of a better way to do it!

The site comes with a track display pre-loaded, and you cannot remove track displays. Each track display has options to change tracks and days of the week. The forecast will automatically populate when you make any changes. A refresh will clear the page; nothing is saved.

Some updates I can make in the future include:

Adding more tracks - INDYCAR, dirt racing, and drag racing venues would be a great addition to and increase usefulness. I'll be limiting what I can do by what the API can provide for free, so more detailed forecasts and locations outside the US are unfortunately off the table for now.

Accessibility - I will be updating the accessibilty features for screen readers so the website can be great for everybody.

Selecting track by racing series - Rather than selecting a track and day of the week, the experience could be further streamlined by allowing users to select by racing series with date and time information already included.

Design - I'm no artist, but with practice the visuals of the site can be improved greatly.

All  track logo images came from Wikipedia.
The weather data comes from weather.gov.

I hope you enjoy using trackWeather!
